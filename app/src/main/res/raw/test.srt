00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:09,779
[APPLAUSE]

2
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,570
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah!

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:18,380
Google I/O, 2016, right?

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,081
Oh, come on.

5
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,080
We're done clapping now?

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,933
Is that it?

7
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:21,900
[LAUGHTER]

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,890
All right, we're done.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,700
Hello, everyone.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,700
How are you doing today?

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,570
Good?

12
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,720
Staying out of the sun?

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,220
Yes?

14
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,140
Fantastic.

15
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,137
Hey, I want to thank everybody for being here.

16
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:33,220
My name is Colt McAnlis, and I've got to tell you,

17
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,050
I love Google I/O. I love Google I/O, because this is the one

18
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,240
time during the whole year that the crazy Googlers get

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,600
to talk to all of you all about the weird stuff we

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,641
do that we can't talk about the rest of the year.

21
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:46,164
And that is fantastic, right?

22
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:47,830
And today, we're talking about something

23
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,300
that's so near and dear to my heart, and that's data compression.

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,540
It is, by far, one of my favorite, most obsessive things

25
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,020
that I ever get involved with.

26
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,790
And I'm so happy that all of you are here.

27
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,790
And all the people standing outside-- I'm sorry.

28
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,400
There's capacity issues.

29
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,660
We'll give them a t-shirt or something later.

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,940
But really quick, before we begin, I've got to tell you,

31
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,580
we've only got 45 minutes today.

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,860
And that is just not enough time to get

33
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,740
through all the awesome, crazy image compression content

34
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,020
that we need to get done.

35
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,070
So over the past couple of weeks,

36
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,510
I've been trying to diffuse some of this stuff to some other places.

37
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,440
First off, here's my Medium.com page.

38
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,654
Has anyone been reading these articles?

39
00:01:24,654 --> 00:01:25,579
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]!

40
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:26,370
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah!

41
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,195
A round of applause if you've been reading the Medium articles, yeah?

42
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:30,560
[APPLAUSE]

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,120
We're live, folks. you've got to make 'em hear it.

44
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,507
Yeah?

45
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:36,840
If you read these articles, we get into a lot more depth

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,440
on how some of these image formats work

47
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,890
and how to make them a lot smaller.

48
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,769
Second off, of course, is the Android Performance Patterns videos.

49
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,607
Anybody watch these?

50
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:44,830
[APPLAUSE]

51
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,900
Thank you.

52
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,050
Thank you.

53
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,250
Thank you.

54
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,010
That's fantastic.

55
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,785
Now, if you've ever been interested in data compression,

56
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:53,410
if you've ever tried to make an attempt

57
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,230
to understand the algorithms, but found

58
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,260
that the math is really weird, or it's

59
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,320
too gnarly of a concept, or maybe it's not presented in the right way,

60
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,570
then good news for you, because Alex Hackey

61
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,090
and I have actually got together,

62
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,276
and we've actually written a data compression book.

63
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:07,900
And we took a different approach to it.

64
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,250
We threw out all the math.

65
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,300
All of that crazy gnarly stuff that makes your brain melt,

66
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,074
we got rid of it.

67
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:15,490
And we re-approached how we should

68
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,120
be teaching data compression to modern developers and engineers.

69
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,080
So if you're interested in a deep, fundamental understanding

70
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,671
of how to make your apps smaller for users, check out this book.

71
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,170
Deal?

72
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:27,787
Deal?

73
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:29,370
All right, business is out of the way.

74
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,130
Let's get started.

75
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,560
So when we talk about reducing the data

76
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,310
sizes of your applications for your users,
